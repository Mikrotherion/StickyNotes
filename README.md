# StickyNotes
Sticky notes module for the E/Moksha desktops.

Sticky Notes module is aimed to be a little project with possibility to add an elegant notes on the screen. 
There are several sticky note apps, but I did not find good E solution. 
Take this project also to be my code excercise for better understanding edje layer and E module programming.
